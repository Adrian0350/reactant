# Reactant JS

This project is intented to be a small and ligthweight reactive library.

I believe the “new” paradigm recently called “reactive programming” is a good one. It makes code beautiful orginized and easy to read. I also think is not fair to be force into a big, slow and complex library, so I created this little fella for small projects to get the benefits of _pure reactive components_, without the drag of using a ridiculous transpiler.

**Disclaimer:** This is project is not yet production-ready.
